# Quintic Polynomial Solver

implement a quintic polynomial solver. Take boundary conditions as input and generate a polynomial trajectory which matches those conditions with minimal jerk.

## Inputs:

 1. **start** - [s, s' , s'']
 2. **end**   - [sf, s'f, s''f]
 3. **T** - the duration of maneuver in seconds
